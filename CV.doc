PROJECTS  I  (Feb 05th-20th 2021):-
IOT Pet Feeder – Build a smart food dispenser for your pet

We developed a feeder to help allocate a specific food diet to small pets such as dogs and cats. It will be very useful whenever a pet owner is outside the residence and/or unable to feed his/her pets normally. The components we used are: PIR sensor, Arduino Uno, servo generic metal gear, speaker, esp8266-01, and a power source. This is the basic circuit for this project. We set the feeder to start beeping from time to time. Once the dog/cat comes closer to the device, the PIR sensor recognizes it and the servo is triggered. In addition, we also decided to add the option to control the pet feeder from our mobile phone, using a pre-defined dashboard made with Freeboard. We saw this as a great opportunity to connect our project to the internet with ESP8266- 01- the wifi module.

PROJECTS  II  (May 23th- June 03th 2022):-
Dodge Bars Game – Design in Python code
In this project, we tend to vogue and implement a Dodge Bars video game. In this game, the player can manage the vertical movement of the bicycle (every pressing on the keyboard makes the bicycle leap without control). As soon as the game begins, tubes will keep appearing from the right side of the screen and move to the left side. The goal of this game is to control the bicycle, dodging and passing the incoming tubes, as many as possible. The game is endless until the bicycle eventually hits a bar/tube, ground, or ceiling.

PROJECTS  II  (Aug 03th- Aug 06th 2022):-
Front End React project – Education Wedsite
I created a navigational page on an educational website using ReactJs. The page contains connection information and various information about the website. It's a project built on React. This is an online education site where you can connect and learn all the various subjects available online. One of the key features of React is that it uses JavaScript XML or JSX, JSX is mainly used for developing the building blocks of the front-end, and it is quite similar to HTML syntax.
